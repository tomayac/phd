  "readme": "\nThe eSpeak homepage is:  http://espeak.sourceforge.net\n\n\nCompiling\n=========\n\nThe  src  directory contains a makefile that produces:\n\n1.  \"libspeak.so.1.xx\".  (where xx is a version number)\n    This is a shared library which contains the text to speech engine.\n    Its API is described in the file \"speak_bin.h\".\n\n2.  \"espeak\" binary.  This is a small command-line program which is a front\n    end to the libespeak library, which it needs.\n\n3.  \"speak\"  binary.  This is a command-line program which contains the\n    text to speech engine. It does not use the libespeak library.\n\n\nWhen run, the \"speak\" and \"espeak\" programs expect to find the  espeak-data\ndirectory either in the user's home directory, or if not there, in /use/share.\n\n\nPortaudio.\n========== \n\nThe \"speak\" program uses the PortAudio sound interface library.  There are two\nversions, V18 and V19 and their APIs are different.  Some Linux distributions\nuse V18 (eg. Debian, Ubuntu) others (eg. SuSe) use V19.\n\nTo compile to use a particular version of the PortAudio library, first copy\neither  portaudio18.h  or  portaudio19.h  to  portaudio.h.\n\nIf you don't need eSpeak to output sound, but only to produce WAV files,\nthen you can remove or comment out the following line in  speech.h.\nThis will mean that eSpeak doesn't use any PortAudio functions.\n #define  USE_PORTAUDIO\n\n\nCompiling Data\n==============\n\nYou can modifiy spelling-to-phoneme rules and exceptions and re-compile this\ndata with the  speak  program (see  docs/dictionary.html). In summary, edit\nthe dictsource/**_rules and dictsource/**_list files and compile using:\n   espeak --compile=**\nwhere ** is the language code (eg. en for English).\n\nIn order to modify the sounds or other characteristics of phonemes, or\nto add additional phonemes, another program \"espeakedit\" is needed. This\nis provided in a separate package.\n\n\nPowerPC and Big-Endian Processors\n=================================\n\nThe compiled data in the espeak-data directory is not binary compatible between\nprocessors with different byte ordering.  For a PowerPC or other big-endian\nprocessor use must use data which has been compiled (using espeakedit) on\na big-endian processor.\n\n\n",
