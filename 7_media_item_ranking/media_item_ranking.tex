\section{Introduction}

\section{Evaluating Subjective Data}

Evaluating subjective data, like \emph{the} correct ranking
for a~set of media items, is a~challenging task.
For different users, there may be different optimal settings.
A~common subjective evaluation technique
is the Mean~Opinion Score (MOS)~\cite{mos1998}.
Traditionally, MOS is used for conducting subjective evaluations
of telephony network transmission quality,
however, more recently, MOS has also found
wider usage in the multimedia community
for evaluating \emph{per se} subjective things
like perceived quality from the users' perspective. 
Therefore, a~set of standard, subjective tests are conducted,
where a~number of users rate the quality of test samples
with scores ranging from 1 (worst) to 5 (best).
The actual MOS is then the arithmetic mean of all individual scores.
Given a subjective evaluation criterion
like the correctness of a~ranking,
MOS provides a~meaningful way to judge the overall quality of our approach.

\section{Media Item Ranking Criteria}
In this section, we describe several feature categories that can serve to rank
media items retrieved from social networks. 
We assume (and are working on) media item extractors that,
given event-related search terms,
extract raw binary media items and associated microposts
from multiple social networks.

\noindent \textbf{Visual}
This category regards the contents of photos and videos.
We distinguish \emph{low-} and \emph{high-level} visual ranking criteria.
High-level criteria are, \emph{e.g.}, logo detection,
face recognition, and camera shot separation.
Low-level criteria are, \emph{e.g.}, size, resolution,
duration, geolocation, and time.
Via OCR, contained characters can be treated as textual features.

\noindent \textbf{Audial}
This category regards the audio track of videos.
\emph{High-level} ranking criteria are the presence or absence
of silence, music, speech, or a mixture thereof.
Similar to visual features before,
audial \emph{low-level} features are the average bit rate,
volume, possibly distorted areas, \emph{etc}.
Through audio-transcription, speech can be converted to a textual feature.

\noindent \textbf{Textual}
This category regards the microposts that accompany media items.
Typically, microposts provide a~description of media items.
Using named-entity disambiguation tools,
textual content can be linked to LOD cloud concepts~\cite{Facebook2011}.

\noindent \textbf{Social}
This category regards social network effects like shares, mentions,
view counts, expressions of (dis)likes, user diversity, \emph{etc}.
Prior work~\cite{Khrouf2012} allows us to not only examine these effects
on a~\emph{single} social network,
but in a~\emph{network-agnostic} way across multiple social networks.

\noindent \textbf{Aesthetic}
This category regards the desired outcome after the ranking, \emph{i.e.},
the media gallery that illustrates a given event and its atmosphere.
Studies exist for the aesthetics of
automatic photo book layout~\cite{Photo2011},
photo aesthetics \emph{per se}~\cite{Photo2012},
video and music playlist generation~\cite{YouTube2010,Playlist2006},
however media gallery composition requires mixing video
\emph{and} photo media items.
