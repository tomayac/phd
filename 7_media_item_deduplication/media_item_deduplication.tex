\section{Introduction}

In \autoref{cha:media-item-extraction},
we have motivated the need for media item deduplication.
By clustering media items, we get a~higher-level view on
a~media item cluster's overall performance on different networks.
As detailed in \autoref{sec:definition}, media items can be
photos or videos.
WordNet~\cite{fellbaum1998wordnet,miller1995wordnet} defines
the term \emph{duplicate} as
\textit{``a copy that corresponds to an original exactly''}.
The corresponding verb \emph{to duplicate} is defined as to
\textit{``make a~duplicate or duplicates of''}.
The derived term \emph{deduplication} in consequence refers to
the act of eliminating duplicate or redundant information.

\subsection{Definitions}

We define a~social media item as either a~photo (image) or video
that was \emph{publicly} shared or published
on at least one social network.
In the following, we will use the shorter term media item
rather than the full term and define
what we mean with \emph{duplicate media items} for various cases.

\paragraph{Exact Duplicates for Photos:}

We define two media items of type photo as \emph{exact duplicates}
if their pixel contents are exactly the same.
This implies that by our definition, a~scaled or recompressed version
of the same photo is \emph{not} an exact duplicate. 
Similarly, a~rotated version of a~photo is also \emph{not}
an exact duplicate. 
In contrast, two photo files with different file names
or different Exchangeable image file
format\footnote{\url{http://www.cipa.jp/english/hyoujunka/kikaku/pdf/DC-008-2010_E.pdf},
accessed November 22, 2012}
(Exif) data are considered exact duplicate
if their pixel contents are exactly the same.
Exact duplicate photos typically occur if users share content 
from one social network on another, for example,
if one user posts a~photo on Instagram that then someone else
(or even the same user) posts on Facebook.

\paragraph{Near-Duplicates for Photos:}

We define two media items of type photo as \emph{near-duplicates}
if their pixel contents differ no more than a~given threshold after resampling.
Examples of near-duplicate photos are scaled versions
of the same photo, photos shot from a~slightly different angle,
rotated photos up to a~certain degree, \emph{etc.}
Near-duplicate photos typically occur if event attendants
stand close to each other and thus take photos
from a~similar standpoint.
Another scenario is a~user applying a~photo effect to a~photo
(like an Instagram filter) and then sharing both the modified
and the unmodified version.

\paragraph{Duplicates for Videos:}

We define two media items of type video as \emph{exact duplicates}
if their pixel contents are frame by frame exactly the same.
In practice, we lower this condition and instead of every frame
only consider frames at shot boundaries.
We make \emph{no} requirements on the audio, \emph{i.e.},
a video in two different languages, however, that fulfills the 
pixel contents equality condition, is considered exact duplicate.
Typical scenarios where exact duplicate videos can occur is,
for example, two users sharing the same YouTube video
independently from each other.

\paragraph{Near-Duplicates for Videos:}

We define two media items of type video as \emph{near-duplicates},
if their pixel contents per frame differ no more
than a~given threshold.
In practice, we lower this condition and instead of every frame
only consider frames at shot boundaries.
Typical scenarios where near-duplicate videos can occur is through
logo or subtitle insertion, resizing, re-encoding,
or aspect-ration changes.
Note that we do not consider video subsegments near-duplicates.

\paragraph{Special Case of Photo Contained in a~Video:}

We define the special case of
\emph{a photo being contained in a~video} if the pixel contents
of a~photo media item differ no more than a~given threshold from
the pixel contents of any of the frames of a~video media item.
In practice, we lower this condition and instead of every frame
only consider frames at shot boundaries.
Typically, this phenomenon occurs if two event attendants
of the same event both cover the event from almost the same
standpoint, however, if the one attendant takes a~video,
while the other attendant takes a~photo.

\subsection{Motivation and Chapter Outline}

In this chapter, we will treat video
and photo deduplication separately. 
Our goal is to deduplicate media items on-the-fly
at the very moment they are extracted from social networks.
Due to this limitation, we cannot rely on any preprocessing
that state-of-the-art algorithms rely on.
This is why we dedicate a~whole section entirely to on-the-fly
shot boundary detection for online video,
which is by no means a~solved problem.
The contribution of our approach is that it is entirely Web-based
and on-the-fly, which introduces interesting new challenges
that traditional approaches to shot boundary detection
do not have to cope with.
Our Web-based approach abstracts away most of the low-level details
like the video codec, in favor of the high-level \texttt{<video>}
API, however, this also comes at a~cost.
A~major issue is the uncertain streaming speed,
where traditional approaches have immediate access
to the video file on disk.
An additional challenge is the unknown key frame distribution
of the target videos, which---together with streaming speed
issues---makes exact frame-wise video navigation impossible.
Our approaches to video and photo near-duplicate
and exact duplicate detection are founded
on a~tile-wise histogram-based pixel comparison algorithm.

\section{Related Work}

Related work in the field of media item deduplication
and clustering can be separated in different groups,
which reflects the grouping of our definitions above.

\paragraph{Image Deduplication and Clustering:}

Work on ordinal measures that serve as a~general tool for
image matching was performed by Bhat \emph{et al.}\
in~\cite{bhat1998imagecorrespondence}.
Chum \emph{et al.}\ have proposed a~near-duplicate image detection method
using min-Hash and term frequency--inverse document frequency (tf--idf)
weighting~\cite{chum2008nearduplicate}.
They use a~visual vocabulary of vector quantized local feature descriptors based on
Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)~\cite{lowe1999sift}.
Gao \emph{et al.}~\cite{gao2005webimageclustering} have proposed an image clustering method
in the context of Web image clustering, which clusters images
based on the consistent fusion of the information contained in
both low-level features and surrounding texts.
Also in the context of Web pages, Cai
\emph{et al.}~\cite{cai2004hierarchicalclustering} have proposed
a~hierarchical clustering method using visual, textual, and link analysis.
Goldberger \emph{et al.}~\cite{goldberger2006unsupervisedclustering} 
have combined discrete and continuous image models based on a~mixture of Gaussian densities
with a~generalized version of the information bottleneck principle
for unsupervised hierarchical image set clustering. 
Chen \emph{et al.}~\cite{chen2003cbir} have introduced an image retrieval approach,
which tackles the semantic gap problem by learning similarities
of images of the same semantics.

\paragraph{Video Deduplication and Clustering:}

More specialized methods for video deduplication exist,
for example~\cite{min2011nearduplicatevideo,wu2009nearduplicate}
by Min \emph{et al.}\ who, given the observation that 
transformations tend to preserve the semantic information conveyed
by the video content, propose an approach for identifying
near-duplicate videos by making use of both low-level visual
features and high-level semantic features
detected using trained classifiers.
In~\cite{oliveira2010nearduplicate}, Oliveira
\emph{et al.} report on four large-scale online surveys
wherein they have confirmed that humans perceive videos as near-duplicates
based on both non-semantic features like different photo or audio
quality, but also based on semantic features like different
videos of similar content.
A~survey of video deduplication methods has been conducted by
Lian \emph{et al.}\ in~\cite{lian2010survey}.
In~\cite{guil2007clustering}, Guil \emph{et al.} have proposed a~method
for detecting copies of a~query video in a~videos database
that groups frames with similar visual content while maintaining their temporal order.
In~\cite{okamoto2002videoclustering}, Okamoto \emph{et al.} have proposed an approach
that is based on fixed length video stream segments.
By generating spatio-temporal images, they employ co-occurrence matrices
to express features in the time dimension explicitly. 
Yi \emph{et al.} have proposed motion histograms in~\cite{yi2005motionhistogram},
where the motion content of a~video at pixel level is represented
as a~Pixel Change Ratio Map (PCRM), which captures the motion intensity,
spatial location, and size of moving objects in a~video sequence. 

\paragraph{Image and Video Deduplication and Clustering:}

A~method for both photos and videos
has been proposed by Yang \emph{et al.}~\cite{yang2009nearduplicate}.
The authors describe a~system for detecting duplicate images and videos
in a~large collection of multimedia data that uses local difference patterns
as the unified feature to describe both images and videos.
It has been demonstrated that the proposed method is robust against
common image-processing tasks used to produce duplicates.

\section{Photo Deduplication}

We determine the popularity of media items
shared across social networks.
This task involves the deduplication of extracted media items.
In the previous section, we have presented an algorithm
for on-the-fly shot boundary detection for video media items.
In this section, we will show how components of this algorithm
can be used to deduplicate photos.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:problem-statement}

Our work is situated in the broader context of summarizing events
based on social network data.
In order to get an overview of a~given event based on a~\emph{potentially huge} set
of event-related media items, this set of media items needs to be \emph{pruned}
to exclusively contain highly relevant media items that are as representative
for the event as possible.
Rather than showing the viewer all media items,
clusters of similar media items need to be formed.
Within each cluster, the most representative media item
has to be recognized as such, according to well-defined criteria.
Undesired duplicate or near-duplicate content in the context of social networks
arises in a~number of situations
that we will illustrate in the following.
All shown examples of media items were actually shared on social networks
and were clustered correctly as near-duplicates
by our clustering algorithm, which we will detail in
\autoref{sec:near-duplicate-clustering-algorithm}.
First, we look at related work for the task of photo deduplication.

\subsection{Duplicate Content}
\label{sec:duplicate-content}

Duplicate content in the context of social networks
arises whenever people either share exactly the same,
or an exact copy of a~given media item.
An example of the latter can be one user uploading the same media item
to the two different social networks \googleplus and Facebook,
and an example of the prior can be two users sharing the same
YouTube video independently from each other, or re-sharing each other's content.

\subsubsection{Near-Duplicate Content}

Near-duplicate content in the context of social networks
arises in a~number of situations
that we will illustrate in the following.
All photos are real examples of media items shared on social networks
that were clustered correctly as near-duplicates
by our clustering algorithm, which we will detail in
\autoref{sec:near-duplicate-clustering-algorithm}.

\paragraph{Different Viewing Angle}

When two people attend the same event
and create media items at roughly the same time
and covering the same scene,
their media items will be similar
and---the capturing devices' qualities aside---only differ in the viewing angle. 
\autoref{fig:viewing-angle} shows a~concrete example.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \subfloat[Viewing angle 1]{
    \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{stage1.jpg}
  }                
  \subfloat[Viewing angle 2]{
    \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{stage2.jpg}
  }
  \caption{Slightly different viewing angles of a~concert stage.}
  \label{fig:viewing-angle}  
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Logo, Watermark, Lower Third, or Caption Insertion}

Oftentimes, organizations or individuals insert
logos, watermarks, lower thirds, or captions into media items
to highlight their origin, to convey related information,
or to claim ownership of a~media item.
An example of caption, logo, and lower third insertion
can be seen in \autoref{fig:logo}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \subfloat[Blank]{
    \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{speaker1.jpg}
  }

  }
  \subfloat[Logo, lower third]{
    \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{speaker3.jpg}
  }
  \caption{Caption, logo, and lower third insertion for a~speaker.}
  \label{fig:logo}  
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Cropping}

Cropping refers to the removal of the outer parts of a~media item
to improve framing, accentuate subject matter,
or to (lossily) change the aspect ratio.
Cropping either happens manually via an image editing application,
or, more often, by the social networks themselves
to obtain a~square aspect ratio
that better fits the timeline view of users,
as can be seen in the example in \autoref{fig:cropping}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \subfloat[Original]{
    \includegraphics[width=0.26\textwidth]{kid1.jpg}
  }                
  \subfloat[Cropped]{
    \includegraphics[width=0.18\textwidth]{kid2.jpg}
  }
  \caption[Original and cropped version of a~photo]
  {Original and cropped version of a~photo (including a~slight color variation).}
  \label{fig:cropping}  
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Different Keyframes}

We have shown an approach to camera shot boundary detection in~\cite{steiner2012shotdetection}.
Different frames stemming from the same camera shot
can occur on social networks, when preview heuristics
attempt to auto-select a~well-identifying poster frame from a~video with different approaches,
typically resulting in different frames for different social networks.
\autoref{fig:camera-shot} shows an example of this phenomenon.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \subfloat[Frame 1]{
    \includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{camera1.jpg}
  }                
  \subfloat[Frame 2]{
    \includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{camera2.jpg}
  }
  \caption[Two different frames stemming from the same camera shot]
    {Two different frames stemming from the same camera shot,
    with the left photo appearing slightly earlier in the video.}
  \label{fig:camera-shot}  
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Aspect Ratio Changes with Squeezing or Stretching}

Aspect ratio changes can either happen combined with cropping
(and thus losing parts of the media item), and/or combined with 
squeezing or stretching (and thus deforming the media item).
\autoref{fig:stretched} shows an example where a~media item gets stretched.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \subfloat[Original]{
    \includegraphics[width=0.155\textwidth]{lordoftherings.jpg}
  }                
  \subfloat[Stretched]{
    \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{lordoftheringsstretched.jpg}
  }
  \caption{Original, and stretched version of a~photo.}
  \label{fig:bulged}  
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Photo Filters}

With the raising popularity of Instagram with its 90 million monthly active users%
\footnote{\url{http://instagram.com/press/}, accessed 02/14/2013},
photo filters that, \emph{e.g.}, emulate retro Polaroid\texttrademark\ or tilt-shift effects,
are a~considerable reason for near-duplicate media content on social networks.
\autoref{fig:photo-filter} shows a~typical example.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \subfloat[Original]{
    \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{clickclickdecker1.jpg}
  }

    \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{clickclickdecker2.jpg}
  }
  \caption{Original, and version with an applied photo filter of a~photo.}
  \label{fig:photo-filter}  
\end{figure}

\subsection{Near-Duplicate Photo Clustering Algorithm}
\label{sec:near-duplicate-clustering-algorithm}

In the previous section, we have outlined
reasons and sources for duplicate and near-duplicate content.
In this section, we describe an algorithm tailored to
deduplicating and clustering exact-duplicate and near-duplicate media items.
Design goals for the algorithm include
the capability to detect exact-duplicate and near-duplicate media items
in a~timely, entirely \emph{ad-hoc} manner, without any pre-calculation.
In general---and especially for big events---event coverage on social networks
is very broad, \emph{i.e.}, there exist more media items
than one could consume in a~reasonable time.
In consequence, it is tolerable for the algorithm to cluster media items aggressively,
rather than leaving too many media items unclustered.
The algorithm has a~twofold approach to clustering:
\emph{low-level} analysis, by looking at tile-wise pixel data
combined with \emph{high-level} analysis, by detecting faces in media items.
In the following, we describe the face detection component
of our media item clustering algorithm.

\subsection{Face Detection}
\label{sec:face-detection}

Face detection is a~computer vision technology
that determines the regions of faces in media items.
Rotation-invariant face detection aims to detect faces with arbitrary
rotation angles and is crucial as the first step in automatic face detection
for general applications, as face images on social media are seldom upright and frontal.
Face detection is a~subclass of the broader class of object detection.
The Viola--Jones object detection framework proposed in 2001
by Paul Viola and Michael
Jones~\cite{viola2001objectdetection,viola2004robust}
provides competitive object detection rates in realtime
and was motivated primarily by the problem of face detection.
We use an algorithm that further improves Viola--Jones,
based on work by Huang \emph{et al.}~\cite{huang2007facedetection}
and Abramson \emph{et al.}~\cite{abramson2007yef},
in a~JavaScript implementation made available by Liu~\cite{liu2012facedetection}.
This algorithm is fast enough to be applied to hundreds of media items
in well less than a~second overall processing time on a~standard laptop
(mid-2010 MacBook~Pro).

\subsection{Algorithm Description}

Our near-duplicate media item clustering algorithm belongs to the family of
tile-wise histogram-based clustering algorithms.
As an additional semantic feature, the algorithm considers detected faces
as described above.
For two media items to be clustered,
the following conditions have to be fulfilled.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Out of $m$ tiles of a~media item with $n$ tiles ($m \leq n$),
    at most $\textit{tiles\_threshold}$ tiles may differ not more than $\textit{similarity\_threshold}$
    from their counterpart~tiles.
  \item The numbers $f_1$ and $f_2$ of detected faces in both media items
    have to be the same.
    We note that we do not \emph{recognize} faces, but only \emph{detect} them.
\end{enumerate}

The simplified algorithm pseudocode can be seen in \autoref{code:clustering}.
In the actual implementation, some speed improvements,
like, for example, looking up already calculated
distances\footnote{\texttt{distances[outerItem][innerItem] =
distances[innerItem][outerItem]}}
have been applied;
these were omitted in the listing for legibility reasons.
We calculate the histograms and distances only once initially.
The clusters are then recalculated dynamically
whenever either $\textit{tiles\_threshold}$ or $\textit{similarity\_threshold}$ change.
The given values of $\textit{rows} = \textit{cols} = 10$ and
$\textit{tiles\_threshold} = 67 = \lceil \textit{rows} \cdot \textit{cols} \cdot 2/3 \rceil$
and $\textit{similarity\_threshold} = 10$ were determined empirically
on a~large corpus of event-related media items
and are known to deliver solid results.
The corpus has been made available publicly,
see \autoref{sec:evaluation-chpater6} for the details.

\subsection{Experiments}

We have evaluated the near-duplicate photo clustering
on two events from recent history with high social network coverage
that we will briefly describe in the following.

\paragraph{Grammy Awards Nominations 2013:}

The Grammy Award---or short Grammy---is an award by
the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States
to recognize outstanding achievement in the music industry.
The annual ceremony features performances by prominent artists,
and some of the awards are presented in a~widely viewed televised ceremony.
On December 5, 2012, the nominees for the 55\superscript{th} Annual Grammy Awards
were announced at an event broadcasted live by CBS
titled \emph{Grammy Nominations Concert
Live}\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Grammy_Awards},
accessed December 7, 2012},
during which Taylor Swift and LL~Cool~J revealed the nominees in several key categories, including the so-called Big Four: Album, Record and Song of the Year and Best New Artist.
CBS suggested the hashtag \texttt{\#GRAMMYNoms} for the event.

\paragraph{Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2012:}

The \emph{Victoria's Secret Fashion
Show}\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria's_Secret_Fashion_Show},
accessed December 7, 2012} is an annual event
sponsored by Victoria's Secret, a~brand of lingerie and sleepwear.
The show features some of the world's leading fashion models
and is used by the brand to promote and market its goods in high-profile settings.
American network television broadcasts the show during prime time.
The show is a~lavish event with elaborate costumed lingerie and
varying music by leading entertainers
that attracts hundreds of celebrities and entertainers,
with special performers and acts every year.
The 2012 edition of the show,
which was previously taped on November 7, 2012
was aired on December 4, 2012 on CBS
to an audience of 9.48 million viewers.
CBS suggested the hashtag \texttt{\#VSFashionShow} for the event.

\subsection{Algorithm Debug View}
\label{sec:algorithm-debug-view}

In order to illustrate the way the algorithm clusters media items,
\autoref{fig:algorithmdebug} shows a~debug view of the algorithm
for two clustered media items related to the 
\emph{Grammy Awards Nominations 2013} event.
The red border around the media item indicates at least one detected face.
Independent from the actual media item's aspect ratio,
the tile-wise comparison always happens based on a~potentially squeezed
square aspect ratio version.
The two slightly different media items (caption insertion, lighting change)
were clustered, because out of the $10 \cdot 10 = 100$ tiles,
$85$ of the minimum required $\textit{tiles\_threshold}$ of $67$ tiles differed not more
than the $\textit{similarity\_threshold}$ of $10$ per tile.
In both media items, exactly $1$ face was detected.
A~screenshot of the complete media item clustering application (with a~different event)
is available online at \url{http://twitpic.com/c02qfs/full} (accessed 02/14/2013).

\end{figure}
\subsection{Evaluation}\label{sec:evaluation-chpater6}

We have collected and made available%
\footnote{\url{https://www.dropbox.com/sh/2llvjaut32juwrx/7eGLodfP_2},
accessed February 12, 2013}
datasets for both events with
379 photos for the \emph{Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2012} event 
and 949 photos for the \emph{Grammy Awards Nominations 2013} event.
These photos were collected using the media item extraction framework
described in \autoref{cha:media-item-extraction}
using a~mix of hashtag searches with the official event hashtags combined
with full-text searches for event titles and variations thereof.
Due to the short-lived nature of social networks,
the returned results of the media item extraction process itself
are not reproducible; our focus in this chapter
is on media item deduplication and clustering.
The concrete clustering parameters for the algorithm were set as listed below.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\textit{rows}$ = $\textit{cols}$ = $10$
  \item $\textit{tiles\_threshold}$ = $67$
  \item $\textit{similarity\_threshold}$ = $10$
\end{enumerate}

In the following, we discuss the clustering and deduplication results.
\autoref{fig:topvsfashionshow} and \autoref{fig:topgrammy} show the top clusters
for the \emph{Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2012} and the 
\emph{Grammy Awards Nominations 2013} events respectively.
We will then pick some representative examples from both events
and have a~closer look at the clustering algorithm's strengths and weaknesses.

\paragraph{Algorithm Strengths:} 

\autoref{fig:personclose} has a~brunette fashion model in a~pink robe
and a~heart-shaped pink spotlight as central elements of both photos. 
Even though the model is shot from different angles and at different times,
the photos are successfully clustered due to the very identifying colors
and the high tile similarity.

\autoref{fig:scenecrop} shows two different views of a~stage
taken at slightly different times.
The left photo covers a~detail of the scene,
whereas the right photo covers the entire stage.
Due to the high tile-wise similarity of the scene detail,
the photos are successfully clustered.

\autoref{fig:lightingconditions} shows two views of a~stage
under different lighting conditions.
Due to the tile color tolerances and the high tile-wise similarity,
the photos are successfully clustered.

\autoref{fig:zoomed} shows two photos of the same model
where the left photo is a~zoomed version of the right photo 
with added black bars so that the resulting photo
has a~square aspect ratio.
Despite the differences, the photos are successfully clustered.

\autoref{fig:stageperson} shows two views of the same stage,
however, with a~different person.
Due to the dominating tile-wise similarity of the stage tiles,
the photos are correctly clustered.

\paragraph{Algorithm Weaknesses:}

\autoref{fig:white} shows five media items with pure white
as the dominating color and a~pure black font,
where users had taken screenshots of the Grammy results from Web pages.
The algorithm in its previously described form clusters such media items.
This may or may not be desired.
Likewise at the other end of the color spectrum,
\autoref{fig:bwtolerance} shows two media items of a~woman
with pure black as the dominating color,
one time with, and the other time without added black bars
to fit a~letterbox aspect ratio.
In its previously described form, the algorithm
does \emph{not} cluster such media items
(unless a~really small number $\textit{tiles\_threshold}$ 
of required similar tiles is selected).

In the majority of cases, though, clustering such media items \emph{is} desired.
Our response to both issues is to ignore a~certain part
of the color spectrum in the algorithm's similarity measure.
In the concrete case, ignoring pure white and pure black correctly fixed
the clustering in our chosen example events in all but one cases,
without negatively impacting previously correctly formed clusters.

Finally, \autoref{fig:weakness} shows two entirely different media items
that were incorrectly clustered as the tile histograms
were similar enough under the chosen similarity threshold.
The explanation for this is twofold.
First, the original source media items were very small thumbnail-like images,
which hindered face recognition
(there is actually an \emph{unequal} number of faces in each image).
Second, the way the algorithm works,
which is best understood by looking at \autoref{fig:algorithmdebug},
causes the tiles of very tiny media items like the ones in question to blur.

We have experienced in our experiments that there is no single perfect
combination of algorithm parameters,
so the only way to address this issue (besides ignoring too small media items,
which in practice may be the easiest and best solution)
is to make the parameters flexible.
In our graphical user interface we have created sliders
that let the user interactively preview clustering changes.
As noted before, a~screenshot of the application
is available online at the URL \url{http://twitpic.com/c02qfs/full}.

\section{Video Deduplication}

In the previous subsection, we have introduced
an algorithm for photo deduplication.
In the upcoming section, we will outline the conceptual framework
of how this algorithm can be combined with the previously introduced
video shot boundary detection algorithm from \autoref{cha:shot-boundary-detection}.
This will allows us to, on the one hand,
directly deduplicate videos on a~shot boundary frame basis,
or, on the other hand, to detect
whether a~given photo is contained in a~video.

\subsection{Photo-contained-in-Video Workflow}

In a~first step, for a~given video, we detect shot boundaries
as described before in \autoref{sec:videoshotboundarydetection}.
To illustrate this,
\autoref{fig:vsfashionshowboundaries} shows an excerpt
of detected shot boundaries for a~video related to
the \emph{Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2012} event.
The first photo of each shot boundary film stripe
is selected as the particular shot's representative photo.
To detect whether a~given photo stemming from social networks
is contained in the video in question,
the set of extracted shot representative photos is compared
with all social network photos,
some of which are shown in \autoref{fig:topvsfashionshow}.
We note, however, that especially for longer videos
(about 4 minutes and longer)
this approach does not scale due to the sheer number of shot boundaries
in common videos shared on social networks,
which causes the process to consume too much time in practice.
At the expense of exactness, (the few) poster still frames
that are typically returned by video hosting platform APIs
can be used, rather than extracting (all) shot boundaries manually.

\begin{figure}[h!]

  \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{./vsfashionshowboundaries.png}
  \caption[Excerpt of detected shot boundaries in an event video]
  {Excerpt of detected shot boundaries in a~\emph{Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2012} event video}
  \label{fig:vsfashionshowboundaries}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Video-contained-in-Video Workflow}

To detect whether a~given video is contained in another,
we follow a~similar approach as outlined in the previous subsection,
with the sole difference being that we need to compare
all detected shot boundary representative photos of the one video
with the ones from the other.
Naturally this approach is even less scalable
with regards to system response time.
The practicable work-around is, as before, to limit oneself
to poster frames delivered by the video hosting platforms.
Our experiments have shown that this approach works very well
for common social network user behavior.
For example, the 3:19 minutes long video of Mark Zuckerberg explaining
the design and engineering challenges behind Facebook's
recently announced Graph Search product was initially published
on Facebook\footnote{\url{https://www.facebook.com/about/graphsearch},
accessed January 22, 2013}, however, people republished the same video 
multiple times on YouTube.
As the YouTube-generated poster frames were similar enough,
and even if the other video meta data like title and description
were different, with the described work-around approach,
we were able to effectively deduplicate the videos.

\section{Conclusion}

In this chapter, we have treated the topic of media item deduplication
from different angles.
We have first defined the meaning of \emph{exact} and \emph{near-duplicate} 
for both photos and videos,
including the special case of a~photo being contained in a~video.
Thereafter, we have introduced an algorithm and application
for video shot boundary detection
whose foundations then served for a~more general
photo deduplication algorithm with semantic features.
We have evaluated the algorithm for two recent events
that had broad social media coverage.
Finally, we have outlined how the photo deduplication algorithm
can be used for basic video deduplication,
albeit minimum system response time requirements
hinder its full applicability in practice.

Media item deduplication of both exact and near-duplicate media items
is a~fundamental step in dealing with huge amounts of social media
and media overload in general.
Highly popular media items not only tend
to retrieve many social interactions on the social network
they were initially shared on, but also tend to get shared
on other social networks.
Derivates of popular media items further add noise
to the social media sharing landscape.
With our media item deduplication algorithms, 
we have effective and efficient tools to deal with social media overload
and to identify the few needles in the cross network haystack.
