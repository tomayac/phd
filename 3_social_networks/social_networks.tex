From the first ever email to video calls on the go,
the Internet has always been about social communication.
Historically, communities formed around Usenet mailing lists or Bulletin Board Systems,
starting from the early eighties, often around all sorts of topics like fine arts,
literature, and philosophy (\emph{e.g.}, \texttt{humanities.classics}
or \texttt{humanities.design.misc}).
Then, starting from the late eighties, Internet Relay Chats (IRC)
allowed people to communicate interactively and in realtime, organized in channels
(\emph{e.g.}, \texttt{\#linux}).
Starting from the nineties, blogs began to spree,
reaching mainstream popularity somewhere in mid-2000.
While the early social communities where created entirely \emph{ad-hoc} whenever someone logged in to a~system,
the first social networks, among them SixDegrees.com in 1997,
allowed people to maintain a~public profile
with a~list of connections (\emph{friends}) that others could browse.
In~\cite{Ellison2007}, Boyd and Ellison define the term \emph{social network site (SNS)}:
\begin{quotation}
\textit{``We define social network sites as web-based services that allow individuals to
(1) construct a~public or semi-public profile within a~bounded system,
(2) articulate a~list of other users with whom they share a~connection, and
(3) view and traverse their list of connections and those made by others within the system.
The nature and nomenclature of these connections may vary from site to site.''}
\end{quotation}

Literature on social networks in general oftentimes uses the term SNS,
however, in order to differentiate ourselves from the therein defined idea of social network,
we decided to avoid the term altogether in favor of a~more open definition of social network,
which we detail in the following. 

\section{Definition of Social Network} \label{sec:definition}
In this Section, we define the terms that we will use throughout this thesis
in order to avoid any ambiguity.
In particular, we show that social networks have
different levels of support for media items.

\begin{description}
  \item[Media Item:] A~media item is defined as an image or video file
that gets distributed via a~social network.
An example can be a~photo of a~baby that
a parent shares on Instagram\footnote{http://instagram.com/}.

  \item[Micropost:]
A~micropost is defined as a~textual status message that can optionally accompany a~media item.
An example can be the status update
\emph{``life is full of wonders, and you are one of them''}
posted on Facebook that contains the previously shared photo of the baby.

  \item[Social Network:]
A~social network is an online service or media platform
that focuses on building and reflecting social relationships among
people who share interests and/or activities.
\end{description}

The boundary between social networks and media platforms is blurred.
Several media sharing platforms~(\emph{e.g.}, YouTube\footnote{http://youtube.com/})
enable people to upload content and optionally allow other people to react
to this content in the form of comments, likes or dislikes.
On other social networks~(\emph{e.g.}, Facebook\footnote{http://facebook.com/}),
users can update their status, post links to stories, upload media content
and also give readers the option to react.
Finally, there are hybrid clients~(\emph{e.g.}, TweetDeck\footnote{http://www.tweetdeck.com/}
by Twitter together with Twitpic\footnote{http://twitpic.com/}), where social networks integrate with media platforms, typically via third party applications.

\section{Description of Popular Social Networks}
In this Section, we introduce several social networks
and their for our approach relevant key features.
For active participation, all social networks require users to be logged in.
In the description below, we thus assume a~logged in user.

\subsection{Google+}
Google+, sometimes transcribed as Google Plus and abbreviated as G+, is Google's social network.
It was opened to the general public on September 20, 2011.
Google+ has native image support.
Images can either be manually uploaded when authoring a~new micropost,
or automatically via the Google+ mobile application.
External videos, for example from the also Google-owned YouTube website,
but also from other services, are displayed in an inline view
so that they can be viewed directly on the website,
however, the network also allows for videos to be uploaded directly,
or be recorded via webcam.
People can \emph{+1} content they like via a~designated +1 button
that can also be embedded on other websites.
Individual microposts can also be shared.
Google+ has a~unidirectional relationship model (follow model).

\subsection{Myspace}
Myspace, formerly MySpace and My\_\_\_\_\_ (\emph{sic}), is a~social networking service owned by Specific Media LLC and pop star Justin Timberlake.
The social network launched in August 2003.
Once in June 2006 the most visited website in the United States, the network's importance
is steadily declining since.
Instead of as a~social networking website,
Myspace has attempted to redefine itself as a~social entertainment website,
putting more focus on music, movies, celebrities, and TV.
As such, Myspace has native image, video, and, via special musician profiles, audio support.
Videos can either be uploaded, or be recorded via webcam.
In January 2012 in collaboration with Panasonic, a~rebranding strategy to Myspace TV was unveiled
with an exclusive focus on social TV that would allow people  to watch and comment on videos.
People can \emph{Like} certain content via a~designated Like link.
Myspace has a~bidirectional relationship model (friend model),
with an optional unidirectional relationship model (follow model),
typically for following celebrities etc.

\subsection{Facebook}
Facebook is a~social networking service launched in February 2004,
operated and privately owned by Facebook Inc.
At time of writing, Facebook is the most popular social network
and the second-most visited website (after Google).
Facebook has native image and video support,
allowing people to upload an unlimited amount of media items.
Images and videos can also be recorded via webcam.
People can \emph{Like} content via a~designated Like button
that can also be embedded on other websites.
Individual microposts can also be shared.
Facebook has a~bidirectional relationship model (friend model),
with an optional unidirectional relationship model (follow model),
typically for following celebrities etc.

\subsection{Twitter}
Twitter is an online social networking service and microblogging service
that enables its users to send and read microposts of up to 140 characters.
These microposts are referred to as \emph{tweets}.
Twitter was founded in March 2006 by Jack Dorsey and launched to the public in July 2006.
The website is ranked among the top-10 websites globally by the Web information company Alexa.
As of August 2011, Twitter has native image support,
which allows users to upload images to the service, however, at time of writing,
webcams are not supported.
Videos are not supported natively, however, as with images before (and partly still today),
an ecosystem of media platforms takes care of that need.
People can \emph{ReTweet} content they like either via a~designated ReTweet button,
or---following the prior, but still widely popular, manual ReTweet convention---by
quoting a~Twitter user by prepending ``RT @username:'' in front of the original tweet.
In addition to that, Twitter offers a~\emph{Tweet} button that can be embedded on other websites.
Twitter has a~unidirectional relationship model (follow model).

\subsection{Instagram}
Instagram is a~mobile image sharing application that allows users to apply filters to images.
These images can then be shared on several external social networks,
and are also visible on Instagram's own social network.
The service launched in October 2010.
Instagram has native image support, however, does not support videos.
People can \emph{Like} content via a~designated Like button
from within the Instagram application.
Instagram has a~unidirectional relationship model (follow model).

\subsection{YouTube}
YouTube is a~video sharing website that was founded in February 2005.
In November 2006, YouTube was bought by Google,
and now operates as a~subsidiary of the company.
It allows people to upload, view, and share an unlimited number of videos.
YouTube has native video support, however, does not support images.
Videos can be uploaded, or be recorded via a~webcam.
People can \emph{Like} or \emph{Dislike} content via designated Like or Dislike buttons.
YouTube has a~unidirectional relationship model (follow model).

\subsection{Flickr}
Flickr is an image and video hosting online community created by Ludicorp in 2004
and acquired by Yahoo! in 2005.
Users can upload a~limited or unlimited number of images or videos to the service,
depending on their account type (Free or Pro). 
People can \emph{Favorite} images they like via a~dedicated button.
Flickr has a~unidirectional relationship model (follow model), however,
also allows people to mark other users as friends or family \emph{without}
the other party having to confirm.

\subsection{MobyPicture}
MobyPicture is a~mobile messaging service owned by entrepreneur Mathys van Abbe.
Users of the service can upload an unlimited number of images and videos to the service.
MobyPicture integrates with a~number of third party social networks.
The service natively supports videos and images,
which can either be uploaded, or be recorded via webcam.
People can \emph{Favorite} content they like via a~designated button,
however, the service also integrates with Google's \emph{+1} button and
Twitters \emph{Tweet} button. 
MobyPicture has a~unidirectional relationship model (follower model).

\subsection{Twitpic}
Twitpic is a~service that allows users to upload images and videos and
optionally integrates with Twitter.
TwitPic was launched in 2008 by Noah Everett.
While TwitPic can be used independent from Twitter, the integration is made easy
with TwitPic usernames and passwords being the same as the ones on Twitter.
Twitpic integrates with Twitter via the \emph{Tweet} button.
The service has no own relationship model, but uses a~user's social graph on Twitter.

\subsection{Img.ly}
Img.ly is an image hosting service operated by 9elements GmbH.
It integrates deeply with Twitter, however, can also be used independently.
Img.ly integrates with Twitter's \emph{Tweet} button. 
The service has no own relationship model, but uses a~user's social graph on Twitter.

\subsection{Yfrog}
Yfrog is an image and video hosting service run by ImageShack that was launched in February 2009.
While the service is deeply integrated with Twitter, it can be used independently as well.
Yfrog integrates with Twitter's \emph{Tweet} button.
The service has no own relationship model, but uses a~user's social graph on Twitter.

\section{Classification of Social Networks}
As motivated in \autoref{sec:definition}, different social networks have varying support
for media items, ranging from native in media-centric social networks
to optional in micropost-centric social networks.
In order to differentiate social networks by their support level for media items,
we introduce the following classification:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{First-order support}: The social network is centered on media items and posting requires the inclusion of a~media item (\emph{e.g.}, YouTube, Flickr);
  \item \emph{Second-order support}: The social network lets users upload media items but it is also possible to post only textual messages (\emph{e.g.}, Facebook);
  \item \emph{Third-order support}: The social network has no direct support for media items but relies on third party application to host media items,
which are linked to the status update (\emph{e.g.}, Twitter before the introduction of native photo support).
\end{itemize}

In our thesis, we consider 11 different social networks that represent all together most of the market share.
The criteria for inclusion follow a~study performed by the company Sysomos, specialized in social media monitoring and analytics~\cite{Levine2011}.
\autoref{tab:platforms} lists these social networks according to the categorization defined above.
