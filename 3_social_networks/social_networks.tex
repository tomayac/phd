From the first ever email to video calls on the go,
the Internet has always been about social communication.
Historically, communities formed around Usenet mailing lists or Bulletin Board Systems, starting from the early eighties,
often around all sorts of topics like fine arts,
literature, and philosophy (\emph{e.g.},\texttt{humanities.classics}
or \texttt{humanities.\-design.misc}).
Then, starting from the late eighties, Internet Relay Chats (IRC)
allowed people to communicate interactively and in realtime,
organized in channels (\emph{e.g.}, \texttt{\#linux}).
Starting from the nineties, blogs began to spree,
reaching mainstream popularity somewhere in mid-2000.
While the early social communities
where created entirely \emph{ad-hoc}
whenever someone logged in to a~system,
the first social networks,
among them \url{http://sixdegrees.com/} in 1997,
allowed people to maintain a~public profile
with a~list of connections (\emph{friends})
that others could browse.
In~\cite{boyd2007socialnetworksites}, boyd
(\emph{sic}\footnote{http://www.danah.org/name.html})
and Ellison define the term
\emph{social network site (SNS)} as follows.

\begin{quotation}
  \textit{``We define social network sites as web-based services
  that allow individuals to
  (1) construct a~public or
  semi-public profile within a~bounded system,
  (2) articulate a~list of other users
  with whom they share a~connection, and
  (3) view and traverse their list of connections
  and those made by others within the system.
  The nature and nomenclature of these connections
  may vary from site to site.''}
\end{quotation}

Literature on social networks oftentimes uses the term SNS,
however, in order to differentiate ourselves
from the therein defined idea of social network,
we decided to avoid the term altogether in favor of a~more open
definition of social network,
which we detail in the following. 

\section{Definition of Terms Used in this Thesis}
\label{sec:definition}

In this section, we define the terms
that we will use throughout this thesis
in order to avoid any ambiguity.
In particular, we highlight that social networks have
different levels of support for media items.

\begin{description}
  \item[Social Network:]
       A~social network is an online service or media platform
       that focuses on building and reflecting
       social relationships among people
       who share interests and/or activities.
  \item[Media Item:]
       A~media item is defined as an image or video
       file that gets distributed via a~social network.
  \item[Micropost:]
       A~micropost is defined as a~textual status message
       that can optionally be accompanied by a~media item.
\end{description}

The boundary between \emph{social networks} and
\emph{media platforms} is blurred.
Several media sharing platforms, \emph{e.g.},
YouTube\footnote{http://youtube.com/},
enable people to upload content
and optionally allow other people to react
to this content in the form of comments, likes or dislikes.
On other social networks, \emph{e.g.},
on Facebook\footnote{http://facebook.com/},
users can update their status, post links to stories,
upload media content, and also give readers the option to react.
Finally, there are hybrid clients, \emph{e.g.},
TweetDeck\footnote{http://www.tweetdeck.com/}
by Twitter together with
Twitpic\footnote{http://twitpic.com/},
where social networks integrate with media platforms,
typically via third party applications.

\section{Description of Popular Social Networks}

In this section, we introduce several social networks
and some of their key features
that are relevant for our approach.
For active participation,
all social networks require users to be logged in.
In the description below, we thus assume a~logged in user.

\subsection{Google+}

\googleplus, sometimes transcribed as Google Plus
and abbreviated as G+, is Google's social network.
It was opened to the general public on September 20, 2011.
\googleplus has native image support.
Images can either be manually uploaded
when authoring a~new micropost,
or be automatically uploaded via the \googleplus
mobile application.
External videos, for example, from
the also Google-owned online video platform YouTube,
but also from other services,
get displayed in an inline view
so that they can be viewed directly on the website.
However, the network also allows for
videos to be uploaded directly,
or to be recorded \emph{ad hoc} via a~webcam.
People can \emph{+1} content they like via a~designated +1 button
that can also be embedded on other websites.
Individual microposts can also be shared.
\googleplus has a~unidirectional relationship model
(follow model).

\subsection{Myspace}

Myspace, formerly MySpace and My\_\_\_\_\_ (\emph{sic}), is
a~social networking service owned by Specific Media LLC
and pop star Justin Timberlake.
The social network launched in August 2003.
Once in June 2006 the most visited website in the United States,
the network's importance is steadily declining since.
Instead of as a~social networking website,
Myspace has attempted to redefine itself
as a~social entertainment website,
putting more focus on music, movies, celebrities, and TV.
At time of writing, yet another redefinition process is
ongoing\footnote{\url{https://new.myspace.com/}}.
As such, Myspace has native image, video, and,
via special musician profiles, audio support.
Videos can either be uploaded,
or be recorded \emph{ad hoc} via a~webcam.
In January 2012 in collaboration with Panasonic,
a~rebranding strategy to Myspace TV was unveiled
with an exclusive focus on social TV that would allow people
to watch and comment on videos.
People can \emph{Like} certain content via a~designated Like link.
Myspace has a~bidirectional relationship model (friend model),
with an optional unidirectional relationship model (follow model),
typically meant for following celebrities like artists,
musicians, \emph{etc.}

\subsection{Facebook}

Facebook is a~social networking service launched in February 2004,
is operated and owned by the American multinational
Internet corporation Facebook, Inc.
At time of writing, Facebook is the most popular social network
with one billion monthly active
users~\footnote{\url{http://newsroom.fb.com/Key-Facts},
accessed November 19, 2012}
as of October 2012.
Facebook has native image and video support,
allowing people to upload an unlimited amount of media items.
Images and videos can also be recorded \emph{ad hoc} via a~webcam.
People can \emph{Like} content via a~designated Like button
that can also be embedded on other websites.
Individual microposts can also be shared.
Facebook has a~bidirectional relationship model (friend model),
with an optional unidirectional relationship model (follow model),
typically for following celebrities, remote friends, \emph{etc.}

\subsection{Twitter}
Twitter is an online social networking service
and microblogging service
that enables its users to send and read microposts
of up to 140 characters.
These microposts are referred to as \emph{tweets}.
Twitter was founded in March 2006 by Jack Dorsey
and launched to the public in July 2006.
The website is ranked among the top-10 websites globally
by the Web information company
Alexa\footnote{\url{http://www.alexa.com/topsites},
accessed November 19, 2012}.
As of August 2011, Twitter has native image support,
which allows users to upload images to the service, however,
at time of writing, it is not possible to \emph{ad hoc}
record images or videos via a~webcam.
Videos are not supported natively, however,
as with images before (and in part for images still today),
an ecosystem of media platforms takes care of
hosting media items on behalf of Twitter users.
These third party-hosted media items
can be linked to from within tweets.
People can \emph{ReTweet} content they like either
via a~designated ReTweet button,
or---following the prior, but still widely popular, manual ReTweet convention---by
quoting a~Twitter user by prepending ``RT @username:''
in front of the original tweet.
In addition to that, Twitter offers a~\emph{Tweet} button that can be embedded on other websites.
Twitter has a~unidirectional relationship model (follow model).

\paragraph{Photobucket}
Photobucket is an image and video hosting service
founded in 2003 by Alex Welch and Darren Crystal.
It was acquired by Fox Interactive Media in 2007.
In June 2011, Twitter announced an exclusive partnership
with Photobucket that made the service
the default photo sharing platform for Twitter,
used for its native media item support.

\subsection{Instagram}
Instagram is a~mobile image sharing application
that allows users to apply filters to images.
These images can then be shared on external social networks
like Facebook, Twitter, or \googleplus,
and are also visible on Instagram's own social network.
The service launched in October 2010.
Instagram has native image support, however,
does not support videos.
People can \emph{Like} content via a~designated Like button
from within the Instagram application.
Instagram has a~unidirectional relationship model (follow model).

\subsection{YouTube}
YouTube is a~video sharing website founded in February 2005.
In November 2006, YouTube was acquired by Google,
and now operates as a~subsidiary of the company.
It allows people to upload, view,
and share an unlimited number of videos.
YouTube has native video support, however, does not support images.
Videos can be uploaded, or be recorded \emph{ad hoc} via a~webcam.
People can \emph{Like} or \emph{Dislike} content
via designated Like or Dislike buttons.
YouTube has a~unidirectional relationship model (follow model).

\subsection{Flickr}
Flickr is an image and video hosting online community
created by Ludicorp in 2004 and acquired by Yahoo! in 2005.
Users can upload a~limited or unlimited number of images or videos
to the service, depending on their account type (Free or Pro).
People can \emph{Favorite} images they like
via a~designated Favorite button.
Flickr has a~unidirectional relationship model (follow model),
however, also allows people to mark other users as friends
or family \emph{without} the other party having to confirm.

\subsection{MobyPicture}
MobyPicture is a~mobile messaging service
owned by entrepreneur Mathys van Abbe.
Users of the service can upload an unlimited number of
images and videos to the service.
MobyPicture integrates with a~number of
third party social networks.
The service natively supports videos and images,
which can either be uploaded, or be recorded \emph{ad hoc}
via a~webcam.
People can \emph{Favorite} content they like via
a~designated Favorite button,
however, the service also integrates with Google's
\emph{+1} button and Twitter's \emph{Tweet} button. 
MobyPicture has a~unidirectional relationship model
(follower model).

\subsection{Twitpic}
Twitpic is a~service that allows users to upload images and videos.
It optionally integrates with Twitter.
TwitPic was launched in 2008 by Noah Everett.
While Twitpic can be used independently from Twitter,
the integration is made easy with Twitpic usernames and passwords
being the same as the ones on Twitter.
Twitpic integrates with Twitter via the \emph{Tweet} button.
The service has no own relationship model,
but uses a~user's social graph on Twitter.

\subsection{Img.ly}
Img.ly is an image hosting service operated by 9elements GmbH
and founded in 2009.
It integrates deeply with Twitter, however,
can also be used independently.

but uses a~user's social graph on Twitter.

\subsection{Imgur}
Imgur isn an image hosting service
founded by Alan Schaaf in February 2009.

and Facebook, it can be used independently as well.
Imgur integrates with all major social networks,
and also has designated \emph{Like} and \emph{Dislike} buttons.
The service has no own relationship model,
but uses a~user's social graph on Facebook.

\section{Classification of Social Networks}
\label{sec:classification-of-social-networks}

As motivated in \autoref{sec:definition}, different social networks have varying support
for media items, ranging from native in media-centric social networks
to optional in micropost-centric social networks.
In order to differentiate social networks by their support level for media items,
we introduce the following classification:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{First-order support}: The social network is centered on media items and posting requires the inclusion of a~media item (\emph{e.g.}, YouTube, Flickr);
  \item \emph{Second-order support}: The social network lets users upload media items but it is also possible to post only textual messages (\emph{e.g.}, Facebook);
  \item \emph{Third-order support}: The social network has no direct support for media items but relies on third party application to host media items,
which are linked to the status update (\emph{e.g.}, Twitter before the introduction of native photo support).
\end{itemize}

In this chapter, we consider 11 different social networks that represent all together most of the market share.
The criteria for inclusion follow a~study performed by the company Sysomos, specialized in social media monitoring and analytics~\cite{Levine2011}.
\autoref{tab:platforms} lists these social networks according to the categorization defined above.

\section{Conclusion}
Alongside the Semantic Web background technologies
that were introduced in the previous chapter,
social networking sites form the backbone of this thesis.
In this chapter, we have thus first defined the terms of \emph{social network},
\emph{micropost}, \emph{media platform}, and \emph{media item}.
Subsequently, we have introduced and described in detail
the most popular social networking sites and media platforms.
Different social networking sites have a~different level of support for media items.
We have therefore classified the social networking site landscape accordingly.
In the upcoming chapters, we will get to the core of
first annotating microposts,
then extracting media items from microposts,
over to media item deduplication and ranking,
and finally close the core part with media item compilation.
